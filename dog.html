    <h2>What do dogs need?</h2>
    <p>Different dogs have different needs. Small dogs need less food and excersize than bigger dogs and some Dogs
      are so big they need more excersize than most families can reasonably provide. Smaller dogs generally require higher quality
      food than bigger dogs and can come with special health risks. All dogs are carnivores and thrive on a meat-heavy diet. Some breeds
      or individual dogs need more special attention from their owners to sustain good mental health.
