                    <h3>Opinions on Dogs</h3>
                    <p>Dogs are loyal, loving creatures who become attached to their owners and vice versa. One of the
                        best things about dogs is the variety of size and temperment. If you want a lap dog perhaps a
                        Shih Tzu is for you. If you want a dogs that you can take on long hikes perhaps a golden
                        retriever. The options are endless and there is a dog for everyone!</p>

                    <h3>Opinions on Cats</h3>
                    <p>Cats have many pros in their favor regarding pet ownership. They are absolutely adorable and they
                        know it. You don't have as much variety as you have with dogs, however; there is a wide range of
                        personality. They can either be clingy or indifferent. Cats are mostly low maintenance but this
                        doesn't make them bad pets. They are great for busy adults or larger families.</p>
